## TE
### Transposable element insertion: a hidden major source of domesticated phenotypic variation in Brassica rapa \
used lots of brassica sequence datat to identify presence/absence variation of TEs... used EDTA to identify TEs, \
SmartieSV to identify aligned/unaligned regions of the genomes (all by all) - unaligned regions were extracted and \
BLASTed to see if they matched TE sequence.  They used some short read data to confirm some insertions. Looked at \
TEs in/near genes and made some conclusions... not sure I agree.


## NLR


## DNA methylation


## Other epigenetics
