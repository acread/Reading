## TE
### Transposable element insertion: a hidden major source of domesticated phenotypic variation in Brassica rapa \
used lots of brassica sequence datat to identify presence/absence variation of TEs... used EDTA to identify TEs, \
SmartieSV to identify aligned/unaligned regions of the genomes (all by all) - unaligned regions were extracted and \
BLASTed to see if they matched TE sequence.  They used some short read data to confirm some insertions. Looked at \
TEs in/near genes and made some conclusions... not sure I agree.


## NLR


## DNA methylation


## Other epigenetics


## Setaria Disease Stuff
### Comparative Analysis of Antiviral Responses in Brachypodium distachyon and Setaria viridis Reveals Conserved and Unique Outcomes Among C3 and C4 Plant Defenses \
Infected brachy and viridis (A10) with a bunch of viruses - not so interested in the differences between C3/C4, but these \
could be interesting pathosystems to try out on our mC mutants.
